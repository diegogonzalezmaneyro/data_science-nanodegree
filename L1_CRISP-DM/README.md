# CRISP-DM

The CRISP-DM Process (Cross Industry Process for Data Mining)
The lessons leading up to the first project are about helping you go through CRISP-DM in practice from start to finish. Even when we get into the weeds of coding, try to take a step back and realize what part of the process you are in, and assure that you remember the question you are trying answer and what a solution to that question looks like.

## 1. Business Understanding
This means understanding the problem and questions you are interested in tackling in the context of whatever domain you're working in. Examples include
* How do we acquire new customers?
* Does a new treatment perform better than an existing treatment?
* How can improve communication?
* How can we improve travel?
* How can we better retain information?

## 2. Data Understanding
At this step, you need to move the questions from Business Understanding to data. You might already have data that could be used to answer the questions, or you might have to collect data to get at your questions of interest.

## 3. Prepare Data

## 4. Data Modeling

## 5. Evaluate the Results

## 6. Deploy
